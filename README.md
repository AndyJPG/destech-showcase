# Destech website showcase

This project was built on the branding project I have done for Destech conference in 2016. Our team at the time developed full branding for the conference including website. The entire branding have been implemented for the conference except the website due to the budget limitation. I created this website is mainly for showcase about how the website show appear in final presentation.
